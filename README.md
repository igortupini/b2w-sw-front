Every time the page is loaded a`GET` request is sent to the API, fetching the nÂº of planets available. Randomly 10 planets are picked and its details stored inside a deck-like array.
The application should always display the first card from the deck, which contains the planet's descriptions. When **next** button is pressed, the card being displayed is removed from the deck and the application reveals the next card.
If only one card is remaining in the deck, the application fetch new cards from the API.
