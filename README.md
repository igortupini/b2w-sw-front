## How it works?
Every time you load the page a`GET` request is sent API fetching the nยบ of planets available. Randomly 10 planets are picked and its details storaged inside an array.
The card always display the first array item, which contains an object describing the planet details. When the **next** button is pushed, the item being displayed is removed from the array and the card component re-rendered on the screen, showing a new planet card.

Only when one item is remaining in the array, the application fetch new planets from the API.
